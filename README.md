# Taxi-Duration-Predictor
This repository contains the code for predicting the duration of taxi trips using multiple linear regression. The goal of the project is to estimate the duration of a taxi trip based on various factors such as pickup and dropoff locations, passenger count, and pickup datetime.

# Dataset
The project uses two datasets: train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv dataset is used for training the model, while the test.csv dataset is used for evaluating the model's performance.

train.csv: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1__eB5gUp7Ap3CHPzsn75kYRgAHmf8XqY/view

test.csv: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GcrhqniKObyqeTJMxKabld0CSGmZ2o92/view

# Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yawwsh/taxi-duration-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies.

Run the code to train the model on the train.csv dataset.

Once the model is trained, run the code to predict the taxi trip durations on the test.csv dataset.

# Results
The predicted durations for the taxi trips will be displayed or stored in a file for further analysis.
